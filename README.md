# T-ridge

This repository provides the implementations of the methods described in [Tuning-free ridge estimators for high-dimensional generalized linear models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11916).

# Simulations

We provide an example code in `SimulationStudy.md` for a comparison of averaged relative prediction errors with 10-fold and 5-fold cross-validated ridge. Developed for `R 3.6.1`.
